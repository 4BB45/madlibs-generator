# madlibs-generator
that's quite literally it; a beginner-friendly program that utilises user input to create a simple madlib
not a very broad program at the moment, i'm working on other beginner-esque projects to strengthen my understanding of python code
all this program does is take an adjective, a verb and a noun and mushes it all up together to make one singular sentence
so go nuts, i guess
